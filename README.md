# Gemini Image Editor

A modern web application that uses Google's Gemini AI to edit and transform images based on natural language instructions. This application allows users to upload an image, provide text instructions on how they want to edit it, and then generates a new image using the Gemini 2.0 Flash Exp Image Generation model.
